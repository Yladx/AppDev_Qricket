# Event-Based Feedback System

A Flutter application that provides an object-oriented, event-based feedback system with star ratings. Each event has its own dedicated feedback section with existing comments that always remain visible, and users can add, edit, and delete their own feedback. Feedback is always tied to a unique event by a 10-digit numeric event ID.

## 📦 Libraries Used

- **Flutter**: UI framework for building cross-platform apps
- **shared_preferences**: Local data persistence for feedback, events, and user ID
- **cupertino_icons**: iOS-style icons
- **Dart core libraries**: `dart:convert`, `dart:math` for JSON, random, and date handling

## 🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Implementation

- **Encapsulation**: All models use private fields with public getters (e.g., `_id`, `_title` in `FeedbackModel`). This hides internal data and exposes only what is necessary.
- **Inheritance**: Shared logic and UI structure are placed in base classes, which are inherited by concrete implementations. For example:
  - `BaseScreen` is an abstract class that provides loading, error, and success handling for all screens. `EventSelectionScreen` and `FeedbackScreen` inherit from `BaseScreen` to reuse this logic.
  - `BaseForm` is an abstract class for forms, inherited by `FeedbackForm` for validation and submission logic.
- **Why Inheritance?**: Inheritance allows code reuse and enforces a consistent structure across screens and forms, reducing duplication and making maintenance easier.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces (like `StorageService`) define contracts for what a service or widget must do, without specifying how. This allows for multiple implementations (e.g., `SharedPreferencesStorageService` for local storage).
- **Why Abstraction?**: Abstraction enables flexibility and testability. You can swap out storage backends or UI components without changing the rest of the code, and you can mock services for testing.
- **Polymorphism**: Multiple implementations of storage (e.g., `SharedPreferencesStorageService` implements `StorageService`) can be used interchangeably wherever the abstract type is expected.
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for model creation (e.g., `FeedbackModel.create`, `EventModel.create`) to encapsulate object construction logic.
- **Dependency Injection**: Services accept storage implementations as constructor arguments, making the code more modular and testable.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Models, services, screens, and widgets are separated into their own files and directories, so each part of the app has a single responsibility.

## 🚦 Workflow

1. **Event Selection**: The app starts with a list of events. Each event has a unique 10-digit numeric ID, a name, description, and status (upcoming or ended).
2. **Feedback Management**: Selecting an event shows its feedback screen, which displays:
   - Existing (predefined) comments for the event
   - Your feedback for the event (if any)
   - Statistics (total feedback, average rating)
3. **Add/Edit/Delete Feedback**: You can add one feedback per event. You can edit or delete your feedback. Feedback is always tied to the event's unique ID and your unique user ID (stored locally).
4. **Persistence**: All data is stored locally using `shared_preferences`, so your feedback and user ID persist across app restarts.
5. **OOP Structure**: All business logic is handled by service classes, all data is modeled with encapsulated classes, and all UI is built with reusable widgets and base classes.

## 📝 How to Use

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
2. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
3. **Select an event** from the main screen (see event ID and status)
4. **View feedback** for the event (existing comments and your feedback)
5. **Add, edit, or delete your feedback** (one per event)
6. **Switch between events** to see that feedback is always tied to the correct event by its unique ID

├── models/                   # Data models (EventModel, FeedbackModel)
├── services/                 # Business logic (EventService, FeedbackService, StorageService)

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Feedback is always tied to a unique event by a 10-digit numeric event ID**
- **User ID is generated and stored locally for per-user feedback isolation**
- **All data is persisted using shared_preferences**
- **OOP principles are followed throughout the codebase**

## 📖 Example Event IDs

- Tech Conference 2024: `1000000001` (upcoming)
- Music Festival: `1000000002` (ended)
- Business Networking Workshop: `1000000003` (ended)

## 💡 Notes

- To reset events and feedback, clear app data or reinstall the app.
- You can only add one feedback per event per user.
- Feedback is never shared between events due to unique event IDs.

Feel free to extend the app with more events, authentication, or cloud storage while maintaining the OOP architecture!

   ```

3. **Usage**:
   - Browse events on the main screen (shows total feedback count per event)
   - Tap an event to view its specific feedback
   - See existing comments with ratings (always visible, cannot be edited)
   - Add your own feedback by selecting star rating (1-5) for that event
   - Edit or delete your own feedback using the action buttons

## Contributing

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in Flutter. Feel free to extend it with additional features while maintaining the OOP architecture.

## 🏷️ Participated Watermark

- On the home screen, events you have participated in are marked with a green "Participated" watermark on their event card.
- This makes it easy to see at a glance which events you can leave feedback for.
- Participation is tracked per user and stored locally using shared_preferences.
- By default, Tech Conference 2024 (ongoing) and Music Festival (ended) are marked as participated for your user.
- You can only add feedback to events where you see the "Participated" watermark.
